#define MAX_ARGS 100

Sets the maximum number of arguments.

#define STACK_PUSH(esp,type,value) esp-=sizeof (type); *((type*)(esp))=(value)

A macro which pushes a given value to the stack and deals with the stack
pointer.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

Argument parsing begins in process_execute, a copy of the command to execute is
made and an array of arguments is declared. The command is then tokenised,
corrupting the copy of the command and populating the array of arguments. The
array of arguments is passed into start_process, where each is first copied to
the top of the stack (order being irrelevant). The stack pointer is then aligned
to the nearest 4-byte boundary. Pointers to the arguments which reside at the
top of the stack are then pushed in reverse order by traversing the array of
arguments backwards, followed by argv, argc and a dummy return address.

We avoid overflowing the stack page by setting a maximum number of arguments,
defined in process.h, which ensures that the entire contents of the stack will
not overflow the size of a page while it is being set up.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

strtok_r(), as opposed to strtok() is reentrant and can therefore be interrupted
during its execution and invoked again. This is achieved with an extra agrument,
save_ptr, which saves the current progress of the method, whereas this is stored
in static memory in strtok(). If strtok() were to be interrupted and called
again, this static storage would be corrupted and unusable by both instances of
the method.

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

One advantages is that the Unix approach minimises the amount of computation
that the kernel must do, this ensures that the kernel code can be shorter and is
more easily maintained.

The Unix approach is also more secure as the kernel has elevated permissions and
it makes more sense to parse commands in the more secure environment of the
shell.

struct child_status
{
  tid_t tid;
  int status;
  struct semaphore sema;
  struct list_elem elem;
};

this is used in process_wait - the parent has a list of children, and when the 
semaphore is upped, is able to read the (exit) status.

WITHIN struct thread:

    struct list children;               

List of child processes, needed for process waiting

  	struct thread * parent;				      /* Pointer to parent thread */

A pointer to the threads parent - needed to change the status of this thread in
parent's list of children.

struct fd_elems
{
  int fd;
  struct file *file;
  tid_t tid;
  struct list_elem elem;
};

This is used as the struct for storing file descriptors, and it contains its
corresponding file and tid. We have included struct list_elem elem because
we store all the file descriptors as a list.
For this list, we have used a static variable in syscall.c. This is declared 
as below:

static struct list fd_list;

To allocate new int fds, we have used a static variable in syscall.c. This is
declared as below:

static int new_fd = 2;

This is initialised to 2 because 0 and 1 are already in use. So when a file is 
added to fd_list, we use new_fd's value, and then increment is. This is done in 
execute_open using the following code:

new_file->fd = new_fd++;

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

When a file is opened in execute_opened, a memory is allocated for a new struct 
fd_elems and it is created. The file is given a unique fd number. The struct
stores the address to the file which has been opened, its unique fd number and
the tid of the thread on which it is running. This is then pushed to the back
of the list fd_list, which stores all of the open files.
When the file is closed, the entry is deleted from fd_list, and the memory is
freed.
In our implementation, file descriptors are unique within the entire OS. We found
this easier to implement as we just stored the tid of the thread on which the
file was opened. One list kept track of all the opened files.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

Read:
execute_read takes in 3 parameters, which are the fd, buffer and size. The method
reads the number of bytes (which is the input size), from the file open as fd into
the buffer. It returns the number of bytes actually read, or -1 if the file
could not be read.
There is a special case for when fd == 0 (which is STDIN_FILENO). This means 
that we have to read from the keyboard. In our code, we have a special case for this.
We then for a for loops which starts with the number of bytes read being 0 and
reads till the number of bytes read is the same as the input size. For every
byte incremented, we read a byte from the keyboard. We then return the number of 
bytes that are read.
If fd does not equal 0, we find the file associated with the input fd (the
file would be NULL is fd = 1). If the file is NULL, we return -1 because the
file could not be read. Otherwise, we first acquire a lock so no other process
can read the file. Then we read the file using file_read, which was previously
defined in the given code. file_read returns the number of bytes read. As we are
returning uint32_t, we cast the return value of file_read to uint32_t. Once this
is done, we release the lock so other processes can access the file. We then
return the number of bytes read.

Write:
This method is done in a similar fashion to execute_write. It takes in the same 
arguments as execute_read. The method writes "size" number of bytes from the buffer
to the open file fd. It returns the number of bytes actually written.
We have a special case for when fd = 1. In this case, we have to write to the console
and we do that using the already implemented method called putbuf. We then return
the number of bytes written.
Otherwise, we find the file associated with the input fd. If the file is null, we
return 0, as 0 bytes are written. If the file is found, then we acquire a lock so 
that no other process can access the file. We then use the given method called
file_write to return the number of bytes written. Because we return a uint32_t,
we cast the returned value of file_write to uint32_t. We then release the lock so
other processes can access the file. We then return the number of bytes actually
written.

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design

Advantages to use the list for file descriptors is that it is dynamic. We allocate
memory when we add an entry to the list, and we free it when we delete it.
Disadvantages are that we have to iterate through the list several times, which
can be time consuming. We could have used arrays or hash tables, which would mean
that we would not need to iterate through possibly several entries. 
But we did not do this to save memory and because in some cases, we have to iterate
through the list because we check the tid of every entry and then remove specific ones.
Implementing a list was the most effective and feasible solution we could come up
with. It was also already implemented, so it was less time consuming while coding.
